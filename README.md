# Rasterization

Rasterization is another rendering technique that converts images into raster graphics. I am very pleased  and proud of this project. It enabled me to develop a program that loads .obj files composed of vertices and triangular faces, then center the object and rasterize it for a user to view and transform. 

There is no need to install any libraries, however, to run the code, you need to OpenFramework set up and include my files in the source code.
